                Before I joined bowling, I was apart of the color guard in marching band. I really like twirling the
                flag, but I quit because of the long and hot practices.

                My favorite place to travel to is Japan because I recently went snowboarding there. My family and I are
                planning to go again this spring break, so I am looking forward to learning how to carve.
